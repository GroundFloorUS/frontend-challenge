# Groundfloor Frontend Coding Challenge

## Installation

This project has been tested on node v12. Other major versions may work, but for the smoothest experience v12 will serve you best. Otherwise, just `npm install` to install and `npm run dev` to start coding.

## CLI Commands

* `npm run dev` : Start the local dev server
* `npm run build` : Build for production

## Notes

This is a fairly standard Vue CLI project with a few modifications added. The project has typescript, vuex, vue-router, [Buefy](https://buefy.org/documentation) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/). Style resource loader is installed, so all Buefy/Bulma global scss variables are available in all components.
